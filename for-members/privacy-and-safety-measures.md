# Privacy and Safety measures



## Privacy

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important:** We will never ask you to give your wallet's publicKey or passphrase, if you think we do, immediately contact our staff in the support server
{% endhint %}

#### Data

we only store the data needed to work, no user-based stats you did not ask for, all data stored for a user is visible to the user itself, for example notifications

## Safety

We try to get your server as safe as possible, here's how we do it:

#### Bot access

only the developer (PieterSpruijt#5136) has access to the bot

#### Database

Our database is secure and only accessible by the bot itself and the developer. We store the data needed to work properly, no stuff we don't need. If you delete your data, it's gone. We create database backups now and then.
