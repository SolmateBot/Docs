# Some more information

What Are Discord Bots? Discord bots are **tools that can help you automate tasks on your Discord server**. They make it a lot easier to build a community that is truly engaged and can be used to moderate your server, welcome new members, or even ban people who are creating a bad environment for everyone else.



## How do commands work?

We use slash commands, that means that you have to enter slash (/) to see a list with commands to execute, see the example below.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

You can run a command by clicking on it or typing it's name.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1).png>)

You can add required and optional arguments to the command, in the example above the "address" argument is required.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

As you can see the bot got the account with the given argument.
