# Using Slash Commands

## What are slash commands?

Solmate uses Discord's built-in **slash commands**. This means you type `/` followed by the command name to interact with the bot.

## How to use them

### Step 1: Type `/`

Start by typing a forward slash (`/`) in any text channel. A menu will appear showing all available commands from bots in the server.

### Step 2: Find the command

You can scroll through the list or start typing the command name to filter results. Look for commands with the Solmate icon.

### Step 3: Fill in the options

Some commands have **required** and **optional** arguments. Required arguments are marked and must be filled in before you can run the command. Optional arguments can be left blank.

### Step 4: Press Enter

Hit **Enter** to run the command. The bot will respond in the same channel.

## Tips

* You can use **Tab** to move between arguments
* Type the command name after `/` to quickly find it (e.g., `/tracker`)
* Some commands have **subcommands** — for example, `/tracker add`, `/tracker list`, `/tracker remove`
* If you don't see Solmate's commands, make sure the bot has permission to use slash commands in that channel
